# Section 20: Visualization for Reporting

## 20.1 Why Reporting Matters
You‚Äôve done the hard work of cleaning, merging, and analyzing data. But managers don‚Äôt want to read Python code or DataFrames ‚Äî they want clear visuals and summaries that help with decision-making.  

**Analogy:** Data analysis is the chef cooking a meal; reporting is plating it beautifully for the diner.

## 20.2 Principles of Good Reporting Visuals
1. **Clarity** ‚Äì Every axis must be labeled, every chart titled.  
2. **Simplicity** ‚Äì Use the simplest chart that communicates the message.  
3. **Consistency** ‚Äì Keep colors and scales uniform across charts.  
4. **Insight-driven** ‚Äì Each chart should answer a management question.

## 20.3 Management-Ready Bar & Line Charts

### Example: Yield vs Fertilizer by Block
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("estate_dashboard.csv")

avg = df.groupby("Block")[["Fertilizer_kg","Yield_tonnes"]].mean()

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

ax1.bar(avg.index, avg["Fertilizer_kg"], color="orange", alpha=0.6, label="Fertilizer (kg)")
ax1.set_ylabel("Fertilizer (kg)", color="orange")

ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.plot(avg.index, avg["Yield_tonnes"], marker="o", color="green", label="Yield (tonnes)")
ax2.set_ylabel("Yield (tonnes)", color="green")

plt.title("Average Fertilizer vs Yield by Block")
plt.show()
```
üëâ A **dual-axis chart** shows fertilizer input vs yield output in one view.  

---

## 20.4 Comparative Dashboards

### Example: Yield Trends for All Blocks
```python
for b in df["Block"].unique():
    subset = df[df["Block"]==b]
    plt.plot(subset["Month"], subset["Yield_tonnes"], marker="o", label=f"Block {b}")

plt.title("Monthly Yield Trends by Block")
plt.xlabel("Month"); plt.ylabel("Yield (tonnes)")
plt.legend(); plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
üëâ Managers can instantly see which block is stable, which is volatile.  

---

## 20.5 Scatter Plots with Regression Lines
```python
import seaborn as sns

sns.regplot(data=df, x="Rainfall_mm", y="Yield_tonnes")
plt.title("Rainfall vs Yield with Regression Line")
plt.show()
```
üëâ Adds a **trend line** to show direction and strength of the relationship.

## 20.6 Case Study ‚Äì Executive Dashboard
Your final report to management should include:  
1. **Key KPIs** ‚Äì Yield per Hectare, Productivity per Worker.  
2. **Input vs Output Charts** ‚Äì Fertilizer vs Yield, Rainfall vs Yield.  
3. **Block Comparisons** ‚Äì Ranking blocks by efficiency.  
4. **Trend Lines** ‚Äì Seasonal patterns across months.  
5. **Insights Section** ‚Äì Bullet-point conclusions.  

---

## 20.7 Reflection Questions
1. Why should you avoid overly complex charts in management reports?  
2. How can consistent colors (e.g., green = yield, blue = rainfall) improve readability?  
3. Why include both visuals **and** bullet-point insights?

## 20.8 Practice Exercises

**Exercise 20.1 ‚Äì Dual-Axis Chart**  
- Create a bar + line chart of Fertilizer vs Yield per block.  

**Exercise 20.2 ‚Äì Multi-Line Trend**  
- Plot monthly yield trends for all blocks on the same chart.  

**Exercise 20.3 ‚Äì Regression Scatter**  
- Add a regression line to Rainfall vs Yield.  

**Exercise 20.4 ‚Äì Challenge**  
- Build a **3-panel dashboard** with:  
  - Panel 1: Rainfall vs Yield scatter + regression.  
  - Panel 2: Yield per Block (bar chart).  
  - Panel 3: Productivity per Worker (line chart).

## 20.9 Section Summary
- Reporting is about **communication**, not just analysis.  
- Use dual-axis, trend, and regression charts to simplify insights.  
- Dashboards combine multiple views into a single management report.  
- Always include **visuals + narrative insights** for maximum impact.  

**Take-home Challenge:**  
Build a **management-ready dashboard** using `estate_dashboard.csv` that includes:  
1. Yield per Hectare across blocks.  
2. Fertilizer vs Yield comparison.  
3. Rainfall vs Yield scatter with regression.  
4. Two insights for management: ‚ÄúWhich block is most efficient?‚Äù and ‚ÄúIs fertilizer investment paying off?‚Äù
