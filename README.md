# 3-Day Course: Python Data Analysis for Plantations
## Combined Foundation and Intermediate Workshop

This 3-day workshop is an intensive, hands-on course designed for professionals in the plantation industry. It combines foundational Python skills with intermediate data science applications, using datasets relevant to the oil palm industry. The curriculum builds progressively from Python basics to data handling, visualization, predictive modeling, and spatial analysis.

**Note**: This is a 100% hands-on course. Participants are required to bring their own notebooks.

## Who Should Attend
This course is tailored for a wide range of professionals in the agricultural sector, including:
- Heads of Agronomy & Teams
- R&D Managers & Teams
- Senior Operations Managers
- Heads of Plantation Operations
- Mechanization Teams
- Plant Breeding & Tissue Culture Specialists
- Sustainability Teams

## Prerequisites
- Basic computer skills.
- Familiarity with spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is helpful but not required.
- Minimal prior programming knowledge is expected. A pre-workshop refresher can be provided if needed.

## Course Agenda

### Day 1: Python Basics and Data Handling
**Focus**: Learn Python essentials and handle common plantation data like yield reports or rainfall logs.

**Module 1: Getting Started with Python**
- Why Python for plantations?
- Installation of Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook.
- Python Basics: variables, data types, loops, and functions.

**Module 2: Working with Data Using Pandas**
- Opening and inspecting Excel/CSV files.
- Viewing, sorting, and filtering data (e.g., finding high-yield blocks).
- Handling missing or incorrect data entries.

**Module 3: Mini Project – Cleaning Plantation Data**
- Hands-on practice cleaning a sample dataset.
- Correcting data formats and handling blank values.
- Saving cleaned data for future analysis.

### Day 2: Visualizing Data and Simple Trends
**Focus**: Create insightful charts and explore data patterns to support decision-making.

**Module 4: Making Charts with Matplotlib**
- Creating line graphs (e.g., monthly rainfall).
- Building bar charts (e.g., yield per block).
- Customizing plots with titles and colors for clear reporting.

**Module 5: Basic Data Insights with Pandas**
- Calculating descriptive statistics: averages, maximums, etc.
- Identifying trends (e.g., yield vs. rainfall).
- Grouping and aggregating data by different categories (e.g., by month or estate).

**Module 6: Mini Project – Visualizing Trends**
- Create a chart showing yield or rainfall trends over time and present the findings.

### Day 3: Maps and Simple Predictions
**Focus**: Build basic maps for spatial analysis and use machine learning to predict outcomes.

**Module 7: Mapping with Folium**
- Creating simple interactive estate maps.
- Plotting blocks, fields, and adding markers for key areas.
- Exporting maps as HTML files for easy sharing.

**Module 8: Simple Predictions with Python**
- Introduction to predictive modeling with Scikit-learn.
- Building a simple model to predict yield based on inputs like fertilizer or rainfall.
- Interpreting model results.

**Module 9: Mini Project – Map and Predict**
- Create a map visualizing yield performance.
- Build a basic model to forecast next month’s yield.
- Present results and discuss practical workplace applications.
