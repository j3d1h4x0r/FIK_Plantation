# Section 1: Introduction to Python & Setup

## 1.1 What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language, designed to be simple, readable, and powerful. 
It is one of the most widely used languages today in industries ranging from finance to artificial intelligence to agriculture.

### Why is it called Python?
It was named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus, a British comedy group. The name was chosen 
to reflect the language’s philosophy: programming should be fun and not feel like heavy work.

### Where is Python used?
- Data Analysis – analyzing estate yields, rainfall trends.
- Automation – repetitive report generation.
- Visualization – generating graphs for board meetings.
- Machine Learning – predicting yields from soil and weather conditions.

**Plantation Analogy:** Think of Python as a “universal worker” in your estate. Unlike a harvester who only cuts bunches or a sprayer who only sprays, 
Python can adapt: one day it helps with yield reporting, the next with predicting rainfall impact.

## 1.2 Why Learn Python for Plantation Management?
Spreadsheets vs Python:

| Task | Spreadsheet (Excel) | Python |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Summarizing 50 estate reports | Manual copy-paste, risk of errors | Automated in minutes |
| Checking rainfall vs yield | Scatter plot by hand | Instant analysis with libraries |
| Creating board-ready visuals | Hours of formatting | Seconds with matplotlib |
| Forecasting yield | Difficult add-ons | Simple models in Python |

## 1.3 Installing Python (Anaconda Distribution)
1. Download Anaconda from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com)
2. Install with default settings.
3. Open “Anaconda Navigator” → Launch Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 1.4 Navigating Jupyter Notebook
- Notebook (.ipynb file): like a digital exercise book.
- Cell: a box where you write code or notes.

Example:
```python
print("Hello, Plantation Analytics!")
```

---

## 1.5 First Steps in Python

### Comments
```python
# This is a comment
print("Harvest data ready")
```

### Print Function
```python
print("Welcome to Python for Plantations")
```

**Exercise 1.1:** Write a program that prints your estate name, number of harvesters, and a motivational message.

---

## 1.6 Understanding Errors
Common errors:
- **SyntaxError**: missing punctuation.
- **NameError**: variable not defined.
- **IndentationError**: spacing issue.

---

## 1.7 Plantation Example
```python
estate_name = "Sungai Tekam"
rainfall_today_mm = 18.5
print("Estate:", estate_name)
print("Rainfall today (mm):", rainfall_today_mm)
```

---

## 1.8 Reflection Questions
1. Why is Python better than Excel for large data?
2. What happens if you forget quotes in a string?
3. How can Jupyter Notebook make your work easier?

---

## 1.9 Practice Exercises
- Write a greeting program for your estate.
- Create variables: estate_name, manager_name, number_of_blocks.
- Deliberately create and fix errors.

---

## 1.10 Summary
- Python is flexible.  
- Jupyter Notebook is your digital lab book.  
- You now know how to write basic programs, understand errors, and run plantation-focused scripts.  

**Take-home Challenge:** Write a script that prints a short daily report with estate name, today’s rainfall, number of harvesters, and a motivational message.
